## Hi guys
These notes are a mixture of my own notes, lecture slides, stuff from the web and chatGPT responses. Use at own risk. May not be complete.

>**Info:**
>The markdown wasn't optimized for github. For the best experience clone the repository of download the files and open them in visual studio code.

### Good luck in the exam
